### What I work on

📉 **Optimization in Software Engineering**  
Why do many SE optimization problems collapse to small search spaces — and how can  
**simple, sample-efficient optimizers** beat heavyweight methods?

🤖 **ML for Software Engineering (ML4SE)**  
Data-driven models for software decisions under **noise, uncertainty, and limited labels**.

🧪 **Testing & Fuzzing (as instrumentation)**  
Using fuzzing/testing to generate *signals* (failures, behaviors, causes) that feed  
optimization + learning—especially for systems-level evaluation.

### How I think

🧩 Many SE problems are over-modeled  
📦 Data is expensive; labels even more so  
⚖️ Complexity should be earned  
🔍 If a method can’t explain itself, it can’t be trusted

### Current themes

📌 Sample-efficient multi-objective optimization  
📌 Search-space collapse (BINGO effect)  
📌 Lightweight optimizers for noisy SE tasks  
📌 Data-centric evaluation via testing/fuzzing
