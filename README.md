**Software Systems × Machine Learning × Reliability**  
PhD @ NC State

🔍 I work close to **real software failures** — fuzzers, analyzers, optimizers —  
and use **data and ML** to understand *why systems break* and *how to fix them*.

My interests cut across **testing, security, program analysis, and optimization**,  
with a bias toward methods that are **simple, explainable, and effective under real constraints**.

### Focus
🧪 data-centric testing & fuzzing  
⚙️ program analysis at scale  
📉 sample-efficient optimization  
🔐 security & reliability

---

### How I think
• noisy systems are the norm  
• labels are expensive  
• simple ideas scale better

---

### Tools
`C/C++` `Java` `Python` `JavaScript` `Bash`  
ML · optimization · fuzzers · large codebases
